Ready for happiness?
====================

Basically helps to transform this source code:

![Hphpy source](http://i.imgur.com/rKbsk8d.png)

to php code:

![PHP output](http://i.imgur.com/lZASezF.png)

and that's it.

Adds some sugar for convenience, while it leaves,
within possible, the php code intact.
